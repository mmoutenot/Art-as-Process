This is a collection of small projects for the class Art as Process at Tufts
University. My goal is to combine my love of programming and desire to do art.

-Paranoia is a app in response to the prompt 'Paranoia has the tendency to form
skeptical systems.' The web page pulls the 500 most recent images posted to
flickr tagged with 'portrait'. It then proceeds to flash the images at 50-100 ms
intervals, causing a strobing effect of faces.

-Sip-Timer was created during an in-class assignment to 'gather data' in the
Tufts student center. It helps measure time inbetween peoples sips.
